# "use asm";

- Subset of JS
- Easy to optimize
- Can be compiled AOT

```javascript
function module(glob, ffi, heap) {
    'use asm';
    var sqrt = glob.Math.sqrt;
    function f(x, y) {
        x = +x;
        y = +y;
        return +sqrt(+(x*x) + +(y*y));
    }
    return f;
}
```

???

subset of JS => it can run on all browsers today

easy to optimize => type safety

can be compiled AOT => ensure performance (no objects, no GC, no boxing, no
bailout, etc. makes everything simpler and faster!)

it matters enough that v8, google's JavaScript team, decided to include an
asm.js benchmark to their real-world JS benchmarking suite "Octane".

---

# Emscripten

- A C/C++ to JS cross-compiler
- Based on LLVM
- Can target *asm.js*

.half[![Right-aligned image](pics/emscripten.png)]
.half[![Right-aligned image](pics/mlocazakai.png)]

???

- It has some really nice documentation.
- Can be used to compile existing big code bases of C/C++ to JS, with really
good performance.
- It's been widely used for compiling video games. Unity and Unreal Engine have
an option to emit WebGL / JS based code, which uses Emscripten under the hood.

---

# Many other compilers to JS

- C/C++: Duetto, Mandreel
- JVM: GWT, Scala.js
- C#/.NET: JSIL
- Faust
- Many script languages: coffee, typescript, dart, ...

???

Faust is an audio language and compiler that can emit Web Audio nodes, so as to 
play music directly in a web browser. It can even emit asm.js code!

How does asm.js and emscripten perform?

---

# What about throughput?

On release, 2x slower than native.
Today, 1.5x slower than native.

???

Those are measures in average, on a set of given benchmarks, of course.

The objective for the future is as fast as, if not faster than, native.

---

# [How does that perform?](http://beta.unity3d.com/DT2)

class: middle, center

# How can we close the gap?

???

Different approaches for that matter.

One of them:
Give developers access to more low-level machine features in JS, to be
able to compete with native.

---

# Int64

- JS has a 'Number' type, that JIT can optimize as int32 or double.
- Int64 arithmetic can be emulated with two Int32...
- ... but it'd be hard for a JIT to optimize with int64 instructions.

???

- No way to efficiently perform int64 arithmetic in JS.
- Widely used in video games, crypto.
- Polyfills for add could be pattern matched, but not for multiply/divide.

---

# New Value Types

- Proposed new value types: `int64`, `uint64`, `float32`, `float64`, etc.
- Overloading operators: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, for instance, etc.
- Might be in ~~ES7~~ ES2016 or later.

# Typed Objects

---

# The motivation

```javascript
    var o = {
        x: 13,
        y: 37
    };
    // use o.x and o.y as integers
    for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        o.y = o.x;
        o.x = o.y + i;
    }
    o.x = 13.37; // nothing prevents this
    o.x = false; // or that
    delete o.x;  // or even that!
```

???

Although we need memory for only 2 int32, we need space in case we store
doubles at some point.

For instance, a JIT can optimize an object but have to invalidate its code
because of bad usage (replace a value by a boolean, or undefined, etc.).

Memory usage is also hard to predict.

---

# The solution

- Add a way to describe structured data with members that have defined types:
**Typed Objects**.
- Types among {u,}int{8,16,32,64} / float{32,64} / String / Object, etc..

???

A plain equivalent to C structures.

---

# Create your own structs!

```javascript
var {StructType, ArrayType} = TypedObject;

// Create a simple type
var Pixel = new StructType({'r': uint8, 'g': uint8, 'b': uint8});

// Create an array
var Square = new ArrayType(Pixel, 4);

// Compose types
var Image = new StructType({'id': uint16, 'src': Square});
```

???

ES6 class syntactic sugar might be extended for TO.

---

# Usage

```javascript
var p = new Pixel({r: 128, g: 42, b: 25});
p.g; // shows 42
p.g = 1337
p.g; // shows 57
p.g = false;
p.g; // shows 0

// Omit a field in the constructor to give it a default value
var p2 = new Pixel({r: 128, b: 56});
p2.g; // shows 0

var sq = new Square([
    {r: 24, g: 35, b: 46},
    {r: 52, g: 63, b: 74},
    p,
    p2
]);

var img = new Image({
    id: 42,
    src: sq
})
```

???

Avantages:
- no boxing processing overhead
- better memory layout
- no deoptimizations due to shapes changing
- => more predicable performance
- interaction with GC, would help integration of GC'd languages (hello Java/.NET).

Already implemented in Firefox Nightly, but still quite far away from standardization.

# SIMD.js

---

# What is SIMD?

- **S**ingle **I**nstruction, **M**ultiple **D**ata
- Processor instructions, arch-specific: x86 has SSE, ARM has NEON, etc.

![Centered image](pics/simd.jpg)

---

# Why is SIMD useful?

- Let's take e.g. Float32x4.
- If your processor can execute one instruction rather than four, you get a
*theoritical* **4x** speedup.
- Massively used in heavily parallel processing such as audio / image
processing, codecs, games...

???

"Embarrassingly parallel problems".

EP: when you have to go through an entire array and apply the same pure
functions on each item.

---

# The SIMD.js model

- Fixed-length: 128 bits (much useful, well supported, very SIMD, wow).
- Uniform behavior of operations across platforms.
- New value types: int8x16, int16x8, int32x4, float32x4, float64x2.
- These can be embedded in Typed Object descriptors!

???

Fixed-length for now.

May include arch-specific operations in the future which presence could be
feature-tested, and platforms which don't support them would polyfill them with
other equivalent sequences of assembly instructions.

---

# Available operations

- Basic arithmetic
- Comparisons
- Conversions and bitcasts
- Bitwise operations
- Manipulate data (selects, shuffles,...)

---

# CAN HAZ CODE? OKTHXBYE;

```javascript
function fibonacci4(n) {
    var x = SIMD.Int32x4(1, 1, 2, 3);
    var y = SIMD.Int32x4(1, 2, 3, 5);

    while (n--) {
        var tmp = y;
        y = SIMD.Int32x4.add(x, y);
        x = tmp;
    }

    return x;
}

var v = fibonacci4(10);
console.log(v.x, v.y, v.z, v.w); // (89, 144, 233, 377)
```

---

# Status

Should be in ~~ES7~~ ES2016 (Stage 2)

[github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd](https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd)

???

Spec and polyfill at the given address.

# Parallelism in JavaScript

- C/C++ users want threads.
- There are `Web Workers`, but they're strongly isolated.
- Generic parallelization patterns are hard to get right (ParallelJS, e.g.
`Array.mapPar`).

???

The only way to pass messages is via postMessage, which is expensive (at best,
copy-on-write, at worst, COPY).

Parallel JS is nice in theory, but it's hard to make a very high-level,
one-for-all model.

How can we do better? How to offer a model that would fit all use cases?

---

# Shared Array Buffers

- Extensible Web approach: prefer low-level orthogonal primitives over
high-level APIs.
- `SharedArrayBuffer` are `ArrayBuffer` that can be shared among workers.
- Add `Atomic` primitives.

???

Now let's quickly skip to the FAQ.

---

background-image: url(pics/eow.jpg)

???

Will this mean the end of the JavaScript world as we know it?

At this point, you might feel like this: new race conditions? deadlocks?
livelocks? sigh.

---

# Fear not

- (There already are race conditions on the Web platform.)
- This is **opt-in**.
- Limited to workers.

???

Race conditions due to network / UI.

With great power comes great responsability, as once said the world famous scientist
Uncle Ben. How do you know he's a world famous scientist?

???

Back to serious: if we put aside new features that we should give access
to, what are the other asm.js bottlenecks?

---

# Compilation time

Matters a lot on mobile devices.

---

# Proposed solutions

- Stream the compilation process (read bytes, parsing, IR creation, compilation)
- Caching
- Emterpreter
- **Web Assembly**

???

Emterpreter: compiling the app as a form of bytecode that can be interpreted,
then interpret this bytecode while we compile the entire codebase aside.

Nowadays, parsing is the bottleneck.

---

class: middle, center

# Transport

???

Code bases can be **huge**.

---

# Proposed solutions

- Server-side compression (gzip).
- Vendor-specific compression.
- **Web Assembly**

???

Compression on the server implies decompression on the client, which is also
costful on mobile.

---

# Web Assembly TL:DR;

A new standard format and execution model designed as a compilation target for
the Web!

???

Evolution of asm.js.

Collaboration involving Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and Webkit engineers!

Not trying to kill JS, which will remain the privileged dynamic language of the
web. Many ways of interacting with it (high performance wasm modules, entire
C++ apps compiled to wasm with JS being the glue, etc.).

---

# Solves all three problems!

- `wasm` is a binary bytecode format denser than JavaScript:
![Centered image](pics/wasm-size.png)
- It is faster to decode `wasm` than parsing the equivalent `asm.js`.
- A new standard makes it much easier to add features.

???

2) is ideal for streaming the compilation process.

---

# When can I use it?

- There's an `asm.js` polyfill for `wasm`, and `asm.js` is just JS, so it can
run on all browsers today.
- Emscripten is getting a flag for packing the `asm.js` code into `wasm`
bytecode, but later will integrate `wasm` directly in the pipeline.

???

asm.js will need to co-evolve with wasm for a short-term period.

---

# But I liked `view-source`!

Fear not, for there will be a

.textformat[[TEXT
FORMAT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/TextFormat.md)]

???

So you can test directly small chunks of code in your browser.

If you were wondering what the origin of the word emscripten was, this is it.
You can craft verbs from adjectives or nouns that sound like they're correct
english, although they aren't. Embiggen and emscripten are part of them.

Emscripten = ECMAScript + Kripken
Kripken = Kripke + Wittgenstein
