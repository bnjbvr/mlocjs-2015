Working at Mozilla on the JavaScript engine, have been working on asm.js,

# asm.js

- "use asm"
- Subset of JS
- Easy to optimize
- Can be compiled AOT [1]...
- ... but runs in all browsers **today**!

[1] as in Firefox [2].
[2] as in Edge too!

TODO: find out how to create footnotes

# emscripten

- a C/C++ to JS cross-compiler
- based on LLVM
- can target asm.js

???

How does that perform?

TODO: include a picture of Alon's presentation

---

# heard you like benchmarks

- On release, 2x speed of native!
- As of today, 1.5x speed of native!
- Tomorrow... 1x speed of native!
- Or less?

---

# some improvements to asm.js perf

- Add Float32 arithmetic to asm.js via `Math.fround`
- Bounds checks optimizations for heap accesses
- Optimization of ternary conditionals
- ... misc compilation optimizations

???
